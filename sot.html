<h4>What is a self-organizing team? </h4>
&emsp;A self-organizing team is a group of individuals who
work as a team toward a goal and have the ability to make decisions and adapt to any changes.
When it comes to agile teams, the ability to self-organize is one of the fundamentals to all agile
methodologies. The ability for a team to self-organize gives the team the chance to figure out
its own problems and how they plan to deal with it.
<br><br>
<h4>Why is self-organization important?</h4>
&emsp;Self-organizing teams are important, and it is beneficial for Agile teams. Here are some
reasons why:
<ul>
<li>Better quality and faster speed.
<li>Increased efficiency.
<li>More ownership.
<li>Increased motivation.
</ul>
<h4>What does it take to build a self-organizing team?</h4>
&emsp;Teamwork is one of the main ingredients when it comes to building a self-organizing
team. Work should be managed as a team which in turn encourages teamwork. Motivation is
also key, this helps team members to stay focused and keeps them interested in their work.

teams helps with communication with each other. Teams should also have trust and respect for
one another. All these ingredients will helps improve your team and help with self-organization.
<br><br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <h3>by Jason Jansen</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;Unlike a traditional hierarchical team, a self-organizing team utilizes the individuality of each member to help spread tasks and limit management overhead. Here are a few features of these:
<br><br>
“
<ul>
<li>They pull work for themselves and don't wait for their leader to assign work. This ensures a greater sense of ownership and commitment.
<li>They manage their work (allocation, reallocation, estimation, reestimation, delivery, and rework) as a group.
<li>They still require mentoring and coaching, but they don't require "command and control."
<li>They communicate more with each other, and their commitments are more often to project teams than to the ScrumMaster.
<li>They understand requirements and aren't afraid to ask questions to get their doubts clarified.
<li>They continuously enhance their own skills and recommend innovative ideas and improvements.
</ul>
” (Mittal).
<br><br>
&emsp;It is vital that the teams collaborate with one another. Without constant oversight, it is up to each member to report and execute their part in the project. Furthermore, a level of competency is required within each individual to ensure decent productivity (Mittal). To help encourage good productivity, each member need to be motivated on their task (Mittal). In addition, continuity must be maintained by providing decent period of work time; not too long, and not too short (Mittal). There are three steps to implementing such a structure: “Training, coaching, mentoring” (Mittal). With each step, the role of the individual grows while the amount of leader involvement diminishes. This is necessary to facilitate healthy progression and competency in each member.

        <h2 id="lcleary">Team Retrospectives</h2>
        <h3>by Laiken Cleary</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;Reflecting on progress is an essential part of improving and completing a project. It is necessary to do at many points in a work timeline not just at the end. Retrospective is learning and growing from the past. Looking back at each weeks progress is good but learning from the past week or part is even more essential. 
<br><br>
&emsp;This class has taught use the importance of constant reflection and retrospective. Our group has come to work together to improve our website, knowledge of agile, and components of a successful scrum teams and master. Learning should come from many points including each other, reviewing ourselves, our professor, online articles, and comments peers. Being open for these forms of communication and feedback means active listening and adjustment based of advice given. Our group is very receptive to what one another recommends for we approach everything with good intentions and being  level headed with our recommendations for we do not want to change the style or approach any of us have but rather tweak to improve. 
<br><br>
&emsp;Our groups style of retrospective stems a lot from each weeks Sprint Plan. We put a lot of effort into those plans weekly thus we use them heavily as a guideline of what to do next and as a resource to look back on. The structure of this class can be difficult for meeting once a week can easily be overlooked and the Sprint plan is a good reminder. Also frequently communication with our Group chat has tremendously helps. In the beginning we were not close enough, however, now we are all comfortable with constantly asking questions, giving reminders, and updating one another. I think our groups progress with communication has come a long way. As well as our writing. Each week you can see the group member become more confident in the topics assign and structure of the article. This in turn makes our website stronger. All of us have grown very well.

        <h2 id="cdavid18">What is a retrospective</h2>
        <h3>by Connor Davidson</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;In Agile software development, a retrospective is a meeting that is held at the end of an
iteration, which is also known as a sprint. In a retrospective, every member of the software
team must answer the following questions: What worked well for the team, what did not work
well for the team, and what actions can be taken to improve the team’s software development
process in the future (Rouse).
<br><br>
&emsp;In Agile software development, a retrospective can be thought of as a meeting to
discuss “lessons learned”. The team comes together and will talk about how everything went
and then collectively decide as a group what kind of changes they want to make in the next
iteration. The retrospective mainly a team driven exercise and the team members are the ones
that decide how to run the meetings (Rouse). These meetings require every member to be
honest about their experiences and opinions and therefore the meetings must have a friendly
feeling to them (Rouse).
<br><br>
&emsp;Agile software development places a lot of emphasis on the improvement of the team
as time goes on and the retrospective is a key part of improvement. After a software team
decides what improvements they need to make and what way they want to “adapt”, they will
change their actions in the next sprint and will improve as a team and as a whole (Linders).&#1645;
