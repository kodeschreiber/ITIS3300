        <h3>by Kevin Kuhn</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;Agile developments history begins in the 1990&rsquo;s with a man named Jon Kern. Jon Kern wanted
to have a something that was timelier and more responsive when it came to software development. Jon
Kern was one of seventeen developers who would meet regularly and figuring out ways to develop
software in a more simply manor. These meeting lead up to what is called the Snowbird meeting which
took place in 2001 in Utah. The group included Kern, programming pioneers Kent Beck and Ward
Cunningham, as well as fourteen others, all well known today in the agile community. These pioneers
were looking for a way to build software faster and get into the hands of the end users and a much
quicker pace. With this new method of software development user received faster feedback when it
came to the software&rsquo;s scope and which direction to go in.
<br><br>
&emsp;Agile development definitely wasn&rsquo;t the first process of software development. If we take a look
even further back the Waterfall process was here long before Agile has been around. Waterfall was a
very slow process moving from stage to stage in an almost sluggish pace. Think of it as a process similar
to that of building a wrist watch. Many people hated the waterfall methodology mainly because it was
such a slow process and that the employees didn&rsquo;t feel valued anymore. Employees hated that the
planning was done up front which then left them with just the busy work. Instead of such a slow process
Agile take on the four main cores that being individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract
negotiation, responding to change over following a plan. The four core values are what makes Agile such
an amazing work process. They allow software developers to work at a faster pace and feel more part of
a team instead of some cog in the wheel. Get out there and get Agile!&#1645;

        <h3>by Jason Jansen</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;As the main successor to Waterfall, Agile has taken a large role in today's development methodologies. The Agile ideology boosts productivity, aligns to stakeholder satisfaction and has a higher chance of success.
<br><br>
&emsp;Based on the State of Agile report:
&ldquo;According to State Of Agile 2018, the 5 most important reasons to justify an Agile transformation this year were: Accelerate the production calendar (75%), Make priorities easier to manager (64%), Become more productive (55%), Better align development teams and business needs (49%) and Improve software quality (46%)&rdquo; (&ldquo;5 Important Takeaways from the 2018 State of Agile Report.&rdquo;).
<br><br>
&emsp;The overall productivity of a team under an Agile structure allows for a constructive and independent environment. Much of the clutter of traditional planning and execution is stripped away and allows teams to spend more time on smaller, productive tasks rather than long, tedious ones. This method continues to develop based on its implementation. The adaptation of the methodology typically starts, &ldquo; first … with a pilot project, which encourages more teams in the same organization to adopt Agile, allowing the methods to spread from one team to the next&rdquo; (&ldquo;5 Important Takeaways from the 2018 State of Agile Report.&rdquo;). Many groups with this practice embrace and spread its usefulness company-wide.&#1645;

        <h3>by Laiken Cleary</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;For one to become a part and prosper on an Agile Team, an individual must first know what an Agile
Team is. According to leadingagile.com and Agile team is a cross-functional group of people that have
everything, and everyone, necessary to produce a working, tested increment of a product.
<br><br>
&emsp;Let us break this down to clarify. The group the definition refers to can be any size of people. If a large
product the team will obviously reflect that with people maybe sharing the same responsibilities of the
project but working together. If a small project the group can be tasked individually based off their skill
set to complete and combine for the product result. An Agile group every member will bring forth
something whether their leadership, organization, technical, or business capabilities for a product,
which is hard to set bounds on for it changes constantly.
<br><br>
&emsp;What makes for a good Agile team you ask? Basically, any characteristic that you would want for any
team either professional or recreational. The most vital skill for anything in life, not just Agile Teams is
communications. Updates, check-ins, explanations and asking questions should be a routine part of an
Agile project and preformed by everyone. Confusion is eradicated when communication is constant.
Everyone knows the work load is being performed efficiently and effectively when updated as well.
Communication allows for &ldquo;Stand-Up&rdquo; meetings to become purely recaps and highlights, so they are
efficient for the team. A team will not prosper either if they do not particularly bond and respect each
other. Respect in the work place and Agile projects are necessary. Everyone must know that their team
members will be able to complete their portion of the project well, so their own hard work will pay off.
Planning is a key component to a well-done project. Any developer is aware of how important it is to
think before you code, this can be said about the design and features of a project, so they should not be
developed along the way but rather beforehand.
<br><br>
&emsp;Agile teams need to constantly be doing 3 tasks. First, they should always be carrying their weight of the
project. Completing one time well produced work that that helps the completion of the project. Second,
an agile team member should always be trying to improve their own work and the overall project. Third,
an agile team member must be aware of how necessary testing is. The project should always be tested
throughout working on it for this is how developers create the best products. If a team member is
capable of doing these three thing then one should be proud to have them apart of their agile team!&#1645;

        <h2 id="cdavid18">The Future of Agile</h2>
        <h3>by Connor Davidson</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;Agile software development has slowly been coming into the scene of software
development and taking over. Agile is a more effective way of producing software than the
traditional waterfall method. Agile lets teams have a less strict schedule and lets teams have
more freedom to accomplish the tasks at hand. A lot of companies are noticing that the way of
the future is in an agile software development process. As of right now, almost every major
company incorporates agile into its workflow in one way or another, except in the case of a few
extinct mammoths[Dubakov].
<br><br>
&emsp;If Agile software development seems to be the best way to develop software right now,
what will the future of software development be like and what is the future of agile software
development? Some people think that Agile is still not as good as it should be or could be &ldquo;is
agile…. good for software development? Yes… but is it good enough? No. Agile is not solving
all the problems.&rdquo; [Dubakov]. These people think that the future of agile software development is
for it to continue improving the way that it is and that &ldquo;We have to learn to do right things right
and fast in any scale&rdquo; [Dubakov]. Others believe that agile will spread far beyond its roots in
software development. They believe that as more businesses develop a digital presence, Agile
software development will become Agile product development and will take hold of these
traditionally &ldquo;non-software&rdquo; companies. They believe that as computers and software begin to
take over traditional work, the remaining work will end up looking a lot like software
development. [Kelly].&#1645;
