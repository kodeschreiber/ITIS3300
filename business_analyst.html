        <h2 id="kkuhn5">User stories and how they are used within Business Analytics</h2>
        <h3>by Kevin Kuhn</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;Business analysts use many different tools when completing their job for example user stories.
User stories are a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature
from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user and what they want out of the
product and why. So basically, a user story just simplifies the description of the requirement. One of the
main benefits for agile teams using user stories is that the can be written at different levels of detail.
These levels of detail can cover large number of functionalities, these larger user stories are known as
epics. Since these stories are so large, they must be competed in smaller iterations by teams. User
stories help in so many ways for example no body wants to read a huge document with so much detail
that the person loses focus and or the idea of the application being developed. During the requirements
process much of the personas and the user research is sometimes forgotten while being written. As the
documentation continues to grow, we lose these personas under all the documentation. With user
stories we do the exact opposite.
<br><br>
&emsp;So why do agile teams use user stories? Well for starters user stories emphasize verbal
communication and written language can sometimes be imprecise which then can cause the developer
to not interpret the statement the same way. Sometimes we write something out and believe it to be
precise and to the point but someone reading that same statement can be on a compete different page
and not get the idea that one is trying to explain. Another advantage that user stories have is that they
can be used in the project planning. Within the project plan teams can then use the user stories to
determine how time consuming or difficult it will be to complete the job.&#1645;

        <h2 id="jjansen3">What is a Business Analyst</h2>
        <h3>by Jason Jansen</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;The role of the business analyst consists of many parts. In some ways, they are the Swiss Army Knife for the company. They fill multiple roles, each consisting of one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Conveying information
<li>Interfacing with clients and coworkers
<li>Solution providers
<li>Overall project overseers
</ul>
&emsp;Business analysts are seen as “information conduits,” in that, they are able to translate terminology from one form to another (Skracic). For example, when an software developer needs to gather information from the user about a particular feature, they will consult a business analyst. The developer tells the analyst what it  is that they want to know, and the analyst translate any terminologies and technical jargon into a presentable form for the client. Then, this translated information is passed to the client, wherein, the client replies with their answer. The answer is finally translated into technical terms and relayed back to the developer. The analyst acts as intermediary between the parties in question.
<br><br>
&emsp;It is also the job of the business analyst to oversee a projects progress and assess any issues or deviations from the plans and models. Some of these tasks include:
“
<ul>
<li>Analyse business needs
<li>Define a business case
<li>Elicit information from stakeholders
<li>Model requirements
<li>Validate solutions
<li>Project management
<li>Project development
<li>Quality testing
</ul>
“ (Skracic)
<br><br>
&emsp;These are just a few of the various masks that they must wear when evaluating project teams. For them, it is vital that a suitable solution can be made to ensure that each of these task can be met. With such a variety of tasks, it is likely that an analyst has had some involvement with each step of the project. “What a business analyst ‘does’ greatly varies depending on what project he or she is working on, what stage of the project they’re in, the stakeholders involved or even the organisation itself” (Skracic).&#1645;

&emsp;Do you have what it takes to become a business analyst? To become successful in the business world
you are going to need to make sure you acquire or have refined skills that could include as follows;
<br><br>
&emsp;<b>Object oriented.</b> Being object oriented is a necessary tool for anyone in the IT, or computer science
world. When you can know the task, completing it, and delivering it results will be spectacular. An
efficient and effective means of producing an object leaves no room for risk, confusion, or mistakes.
<br><br>
&emsp;<b>Communication.</b> Communication is critical in any form of business. However, a BA must have extremely
refined verbal communication skills. This can be a difficult skill for people who excel in the IT realm but is
vital to clear execution with a team, asking questions or just relaying information to stakeholders.
<br><br>
&emsp;<b>Stakeholders.</b> Being a business analyst means that you are high in the chain for command. No matter
how accomplished of a BA you become though you must always report to stakeholders. This means
constant updating either verbally, through email or whatever means they prefer. Answering questions
and simplifying matters if necessary. Satisfying stakeholders needs can become tedious but is always
vital for the product is their wish and command.
<br><br>
&emsp;<b>Listening.</b> As much communication you will have to do with your team and stakeholders to be a
successful BA you must also have proper listening skills. This means retaining the information people tell
you not just haring it. Never judge any idea or concept told to you. Understand context that may not be
provided to you. And remember tone and body language are essential parts to all communication
whether verbal, listening, relaying, or electronically and people will notice and react based of these
signals.
<br><br>
&emsp;<b>Presentation.</b> Presentation can be so broad for a BA. Whether a workshop, meeting with stakeholders,
presenting a final project, pitching an idea. Or as simple as how you present feedback, your content for
day to day interactions. Small and large presentations are vital for relaying information is always key to
the second skill a BA needs communication.
<br><br>
&emsp;Many skills are necessary to be a successful BA beyond these 5 but one must start somewhere so
develop and refine these skills if you wish to be the best.&#1645;

        <h2 id="cdavid18">Where business analysts fit into a business</h2>
        <h3>by Connor Davidson</h3>
        <p>
&emsp;A business analyst is someone who helps the team by working with stakeholders to
define their business needs and to extract their requirements for what they want to be
delivered (Skracic). One of the main responsibilities is to make sure that the requirements are
understood by everyone on the team and to all relevant stakeholders (Skracic). A business
analyst’s position in a company can vary. They do a lot of different jobs and have lots of
responsibilities. Business Analysts may have to scan the market to verify that the team is up to
government regulations and law, ensure that the team is up to par with what the rest of the
industry is doing, analyze business needs, define business cases, model requirements, validate
solutions, and other things. The business analyst generally will be the person that talks to a
variety of stakeholders and organizes all of their different needs and communicate a clear
understanding between everybody. The business analyst role is especially important in bridging
the gap between the IT side and the business side (Skracic). The business analyst plays a key
role in businesses because the business side and the IT side may not always be able to clearly
communicate in a way that the other side understands. The business analyst is informed on
both sides and serves as a common middle ground between the two.&#1645;
