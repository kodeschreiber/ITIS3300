&emsp;Project Management has been utilized throughout time for it is vital to be successful. Project management can be traced as far back as the pyramids required plans, leaders and managers. Teamwork is necessary but can become complicated very easily. Thus having a project manager that the team trust and follows allows for better cooperation and achievement results. Having a system of project management is necessary in all fields whether construction, art, cooking, or information technology. This article will address where IT project management was developed, and what are some of the best techniques that have been developed along the way.<br><br>

&emsp;Since information technology is relatively new so is the history of IT project management. Not that it could be pinpointed to a certain time, but the influential period began around the 1920’s. A “forefather” for project management, Henry Gantt, created a self-named scheduling diagram called the Gantt chart. The radical idea is still used today as a handy tool for project managers. Although developed for construction it easily is applied to IT projects for its clear and simplistic approach to organization.<br><br>

&emsp;In the late 1950’s The American Association of Cost Engineers was formed as a professional society that built framework for planning, scheduling, cost and schedule control, and cost estimating. With the basis for these in portfolios project managers were capable to accomplishing more. Around this time as well The Critical Path technique was created at Dupont. This process predicted roughly how long a project would take, thus creating a universal and easy predictor.<br>

&emsp;Many project management techniques can be admitted to US military and defense. These departments need for organization drove a necessity to create project management techniques that have since been applied to IT. Program Evaluation Review evaluates the time necessary to complete individual task and then calculated the minimum time to complete the entirety of a project. The Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical tree structure that identifies the deliverables and tasks of a project in a top-down order.<br><br>

&emsp;A major component of IT project management is, The Project Management Institute, that was founded in 1969. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge creates a standard for process and knowledge that are crucial for project managers. The institute also offers highly appraised certifications like; Certified Associate in Project Management and Project Management Professional.<br><br>
 
&emsp;In the late 1980’s Scrum a Agile software development model was created. This system allows multiple small teams to work independently yet cooperatively creating a new project management style. It has helped management move into use with general projects.  Earned Value Management was not a new concept to this time but rather a tweaked one. EVM was now know for being the measurement of project performances through a systematic process using variances or work performed and worked planned. This revamped concept became a useful tool in determining schedule control and cost.<br><br>

&emsp;These programs, concepts, systems, and plans plus many others have created the IT project management we have come to know in this class and other experiences. The simplistic and detailed process a project requires with defining, planning, doing, and review may seem straightforward but requires a detail-oriented project manager, and team to complete. Without the history or trial and error past IT project managers have attempted systems like the one we have today would not be in place. Thus our history is necessary for our current and future of IT project management. &#1645;
